"""
Create 3 classes with interconnection between them (Student, Teacher,
Homework)
Use datetime module for working with date/time
1. Homework takes 2 attributes for __init__: tasks text and number of days to complete
Attributes:
    text - task text
    deadline - datetime.timedelta object with date until task should be completed
    created - datetime.datetime object when the task was created
Methods:
    is_active - check if task already closed
2. Student
Attributes:
    last_name
    first_name
Methods:
    do_homework - request Homework object and returns it,
    if Homework is expired, prints 'You are late' and returns None
3. Teacher
Attributes:
     last_name
     first_name
Methods:
    create_homework - request task text and number of days to complete, returns Homework object
    Note that this method doesn't need object itself
PEP8 comply strictly.
