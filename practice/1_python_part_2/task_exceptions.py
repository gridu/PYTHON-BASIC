Write a function which divides x by y.
If y == 0 it should print "Division by 0" and return None
elif y == 1 it should raise custom Exception with "Deletion on 1 get the same result" text
else it should return the result of division
In all cases it should print "Division finished"
    >>> division(1, 0)
    Division by 0
    Division finished
